Stage 2: Don Giovanni

CaseNum: 801-1-77926009-2816450

Our person in the box office at the Console City opera house has just 
informed us that the influential order of Swartz will be attending Don Giovanni tonight. 
This vein lot should be easy to spot thanks to their distinguished geek glasses. 
They must be up to something kid...

They are all sitting in the 9th seat of each row.

We better act fast and tighten up our operation. This is a slicker operation than before,
 youâ€™ll have to use a single for loop to pick them out and set found property of 
 the theatregoers to true

Solve the case using only:
For (not nested)
theatregoers[ ][ ]
